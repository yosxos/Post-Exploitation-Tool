 Post exploitation tool using TCP connection written in Rust

## implemented methods:
- Accessing the List of users 
- Viewing the server logs. 
- Slow down requests incoming from the beacon.
- Speeding up the requests incoming from the beacon.
- Destroying the beacon if it lost connection to the server for more than 7 days.
- Uploading and downloading files between the attacker and beacon .

## To Do :
- Adding reverse shell to the beacon
- Starting the beacon upon start-up
- Crypting the messages

## How to run 
### To run the server :
- `cd server`
- `cargo build` then `cargo run`
### To run the attacker :
- `cd attacker`
- `cargo build` then `cargo run`
### To run the beacon :
- `cd beacon`
- `cargo build` then `cargo run`
## Commands:
 ### As an attacker:
 - To get the list of connected users : `users`
 - To view the server logs : `getlogs`
 - To upload a file to the beacon : `upload`
